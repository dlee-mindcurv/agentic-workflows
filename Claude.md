## Introduction
Welcome to the project AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management! Imagine yourself as a highly sought-after AI Workflow Architect who specializes in implementing intelligent agentic systems that don't just automate tasks, but dynamically manage them. Your newest client, InnovateNext Solutions, a rapidly scaling startup brimming with brilliant ideas but hampered by inconsistent project execution, has a critical challenge they believe only you can solve.

They are seeking a revolutionary way to manage their entire product development lifecycle. Your goal is to step in and engineer a sophisticated, reusable agentic workflow. This agentic workflow will assist the existing technical project managers (TPMs) on their team by ensuring their various product ideas can be consistently and scalably transformed into well-defined user stories, product features, and detailed engineering tasks. You will pioneer this system by first applying it to their upcoming "Email Router" project as a pilot.

## The Challenge: Building a Scalable Engine for Innovation
TPMs at InnovateNext Solutions are overburdened and face a significant bottleneck: due to their significant workload, turning the multiple product ideas they are handling, into actionable development plans is leading to miscommunications, varied output quality, and delays across all their projects. They need a foundational, AI-driven project management framework that can be applied company-wide.

Your role as an AI Workflow Architect is twofold:

First, you'll construct a robust library of diverse, reusable AI agents – the versatile building blocks for this and future advanced agentic systems. This is about crafting your core, adaptable toolkit.
Then, you'll deploy a selection of these agents to build the general-purpose agentic workflow for technical project management. You will demonstrate its power and flexibility by using their "Email Router" product specification (Product-Spec-Email-Router.txt) as the initial input for this pilot implementation.
The Audience for your solution are the technical project managers and the leadership team, particularly the Head of Product and Lead Technical Program Manager, at InnovateNext Solutions. They are looking for a robust system that not only works for the Email Router but also assists the technical project managers at InnovateNext for future product development.

## Your Product: AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management (Pilot: Email Router)
You will deliver a two-part solution:

### Phase 1: The Agentic Toolkit  (FILE: ./Phase1.md)

A Python package (workflow_agents) containing seven meticulously crafted and individually tested agent classes (base_agents.py):
DirectPromptAgent
AugmentedPromptAgent
KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent
RAGKnowledgePromptAgent (provided, but understand its role)
EvaluationAgent
RoutingAgent
ActionPlanningAgent
Standalone test scripts for each agent, proving their individual capabilities, along with screenshots of successful test runs.

### Phase 2: The Project Management Workflow Implementation (FILE: ./Pahse2.md)

A primary Python script (agentic_workflow.py) that orchestrates a selection of your Phase 1 agents (ActionPlanningAgent, KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent, EvaluationAgent, RoutingAgent) to perform the multi-step technical project management task. This script will be designed as a general-purpose workflow.

For the pilot, this workflow will:

Accept a high-level prompt (simulating a TPM's request) and InnovateNext's Product-Spec-Email-Router.txt (as the example product spec).
Employ an Action Planning Agent to break down the overall goal into logical sub-tasks.
Utilize a Routing Agent to intelligently assign each sub-task to the appropriate specialized agent team.
Simulate a Product Manager team (a KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for generating user stories based on the provided product spec, paired with an EvaluationAgent to ensure stories meet specific criteria.
Simulate a Program Manager team (a KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for defining product features, paired with an EvaluationAgent to ensure features meet criteria.
Simulate a Development Engineer team (a KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for creating detailed engineering tasks, paired with an EvaluationAgent to ensure tasks meet criteria.
Produce a final, structured output representing the comprehensively planned project (for the Email Router), demonstrating the workflow's capability.
## Project Submission
At the end of the project, you will need to submit the following documents for review:

Phase 1:
Fully implemented reusable agent library (workflow_agents/base_agents.py).
Test scripts for each agent in the reusable agent library
Outputs from running the seven testing scripts in the form of screenshots or text files containing terminal outputs.
Phase 2:
Completed Python script (agentic_workflow.py) which implements the agentic workflow for technical project management for the email router product specification.
Output from the agentic workflow in the form of screenshots or a text file containing the terminal output.
